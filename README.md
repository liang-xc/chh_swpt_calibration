# chh_swpt_calibration

Replication of Chen et al. (2018). <br>

This project contains a "model-free" calibration scheme of ATM swaptions, assuming log-normally distributed forward price based on Jamshidian decomposition. This can easily be extended into the multi-curve framework for pricing purposes. More details can be found in Chen et al. (2018).
